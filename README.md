## Overview

This project aims to build a full-featured e-commerce front end using Angular.  
The current state is *incomplete*, meaning many features are still under construction or missing, UI / UX is a work in progress, and some endpoints may be assumed or stubbed out.

---

## Features

Below features are **implemented**, **partially implemented**, or **planned** (you can tag as you prefer):

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Product listing with filters & categories | ✅ – basic |
| Product detail pages | ⚠️ – partial / placeholder |
| Shopping cart functionality | ⚠️ – cart operations partially working |
| Checkout flow | ✅ – basic |
| User authentication (login/register) | ✅ – basic |
| User profile / order history | ❌ – planned |
| Responsive mobile-first UI | ✅ – basic responsiveness |
| Styles via Angular / CSS / (possibly Tailwind or your choice) | ✅ / ⚠️ depending on module |

---

## Architecture & Technologies

Here are some of the tools, frameworks, and patterns being used or planned:

- **Frontend**: Angular (TypeScript)  
- **Styling / UI**: CSS / (optional: Tailwind / other component libraries)  
- **State management**: (e.g. RxJS, services)  
- **API interactions**: HTTPClient to communicate with backend REST endpoints  
- **Routing**: Angular Router  
- **Build & Tooling**: Angular CLI, node / npm  
- **Testing**: (unit tests / e2e to be added)

You may have additional config files (linting, formatting, environment settings) as needed.

---

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14-18+, whichever version you target)  
- npm (or yarn)  
- Angular CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)  
- Backend (API) available or mocked — since frontend depends on API endpoints  

### Installation

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/zougibe/Angular-Ecommerce-incomplete.git
cd Angular-Ecommerce-incomplete

# install dependencies
npm install
````

### Running

```bash
# to start the app in development mode
ng serve
```

By default, it will run at `http://localhost:4200/`. Adjust configurations if different.

### Configuration

If there are environment settings (API base URL, tokens, etc.), ensure you have those configured in `src/environments/` (or however you manage them).

## To Do / Missing Pieces

Here are what’s missing / what needs work / possible enhancements:

* Complete checkout flow (order creation, payment integration)
* Product detail page content (reviews, images, variants)
* User registration/login with real backend
* Profile & order history pages
* Error handling & edge cases
* Tests: unit & e2e
* Better UI / polished styles, mobile UX
* State management refinements
* Deployment setup

If you are collaborating, please pick items from this list or suggest more.
